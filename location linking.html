<h3><u><a href="#j4">GO TO TOP</u></a></h3>
<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations- Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than
one ldnd of problem-</p>
<h4><u>cpu</u><h4>
	<p>A central processing unit (CPU)- also referred to as a central processor unit-is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical-
logical- and input"'output operations of the system- The term has been in use in the computer indusz at least since the early 196os-The form: design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course
of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same</p>
<h3><u>ALU</u></h3>
<p>In computing- an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations- The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer-
and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers- The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) accommodate very powerful and
very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs-</p>

<h4><u>C</u></h4>
<p>C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. Therefore, C was useful for many applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, for example in system programming.

<h3><u>c++</u></h3>
<p>C++ (pronounced cee plus plus, /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulatio
